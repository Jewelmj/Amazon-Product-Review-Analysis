0,"Cons first:
1. Bad Switches, mine started double clicking before an year of daily use.
2. Not ideal for big hands or palm grip.

Pros:
1. G Hub is decent with useful features, I don't use it though
2. Battery life is good, single battery lasts for months
3. Service is good with good warranty for 2 years and instant replacement if there's any fault
4. Zero lags, performance is ideal for gaming and regular use.

Overall, this would've been a good mouse had Logitech used decent switches, all Logitech mouse tend to double click after a while and yet they've refused to switch to a different switch.",Reviewed in India on 29 December 2022

21,"It does everything it says on the tin. It's lightweight, the sensor is excellent, it runs off AA batteries.

Not only that, but it's a good mouse if you travel around a lot. As of writing this review, I've used this daily for 12-18 hours without charging.

The downsides I can find with this is that the software for it is confusing. Also, something to note is that you need to register the product on the website to claim your warranty, and they won't let you upload a receipt. So make sure you keep the invoice in a PDF (you can get one from Amazon orders page) somewhere safe like a cloud storage. Otherwise, you might have a terrible time if you want to claim warranty.",Reviewed in India on 30 January 2023

25,"Been using for 6 months. Average 2 - 2.30 hours FPS gaming per day, changed battery only twice.

Sensor - awesome

No click issue whatsoever, glides accross rubber pad no friction.

Weight was a lil bit issue, what I did was change the AA to AAA with a converter (online pricy local cheap). It went from 99 grams to 76 grams, huge difference for me as low sense user.","Reviewed in India on January 9, 2023"
26,Mine came with a manufacturing defect the right click button wouldn't work. I had to open the mouse and reattach all the wires . Not worth the money,"Reviewed in India on January 9, 2023"
27,"I bought this mouse like a couple months ago from amazon, and its been working great for me. I have never had issues with response times or stuff like that. But recently since the past few weeks, the quality of connection of this mouse has dropped drastically. I find it lagging in game and during my editing process, it also keeps double clicking for some reason, or not registering clicks at all (sometimes). The hold on the left click isn't working properly and it disconnects the hold.

Also, the dpi change led stopped working around the same month that I got this mouse, but it wasn't THAT important so....

Conclusion: I have been using this mouse for quite some time, and it has been Awesome, the build, the fit in the hand, the response times, all great, just these few minor (but annoying) issues that have started popping up recently.

I've replaced battery so atleast looks like mouse is working fine but dongle just won't connect. i've used a logitech wireless mouse before of my sister but it was a normal one but this. No device detected is the issue i've been getting and i've tried every solution in book. i'm gonna try to replace it but if it doesn't work then this was my worst purchase and i'm kinda disappointed with amazon.

 Perfect for casual game
I don't know about pro scene, but I do play Valorant, Apex legends, some AAA titles
Zero complaint
Kept a Duracell battery AA , it's been a month, I checked in logitech software battery is still around 80%

50,It's a perfect budget killer ..... 12 to 13 cps butterfly clicking .Land jitter clicking both ...... awesome battery life ..... Clicks are super smooth ...... No statement for sensor it's already on a whole next level ...... If you are looking for a mouse around 3000 to 3500 go for it you won't regret it believe me ...... Yes it's a bit heavy like 99 grams but that can be managed using a AA battery with converter (I am using it that way and believe me it's perfect in weight balance after that) ....

I have been using this mouse for the past 2 years. Surprisingly, the Duracell battery lasts around 1 year in this mouse in performance mode. This is basically the Logitech G102, just wireless. Hand feel is great, fits perfectly, has the perfect weight balance and size. I don't know why anyone would prefer any other mouse.

For people complaining about the double-click issue, I agree because I just started facing this issue after 2 years. Thinking of buying the same mouse again though since this","Reviewed in India on November 8, 2022"

56,"So i got the mouse a couple months ago and it has been working fine since, i've faced no issues so far, well except the part that the logitech logo is kinda wearing off now, but im sure that most of us who are getting this mouse aren't getting it for the looks, but for the performance instead, becoz i believe that most of the ppl who are getting this are either serious gamers on a budget, or casual gamers who take things a bit more seriously than others.
Ghub works fine, dont listen to ppl crying that notifications pop when they change dpi, JUST DISABLE THE DPI OR TURN THE NOTIFICATOINS OFF DAMMID, OR JUST TURN FOCUS ASSIST MODE ON ON UR PC WHILE GAMING.
ghub keeps getting regular updates which is good to know becoz ik that the ppl over at logitech are keeping things in check
there are a ton of macro key functions which i haven't even touched becoz i just use this as a gaming primary mouse and i dont stream or somthn
okay im done writing this review, its 2 am and its getting late, just buy this if u prefer functionality and performance over looks.
oh also, it being wireless is a huge plus and you'll always find new mouse skates and stickers to customize it easily because logi is a huge brand (if you didnt know that then idk what type of rock you are living under) and almost most online stores have accessories for this mouse, okay thats it im done bei","Reviewed in India on November 3, 2022"

Mouse is good, design is perfect for my hand shape..
Upgraded from g102 because of shape.
Definately have a better sensor then g102.
Only problem is those cheap switches rated only at 10mil clicks
Not even 6 months after use started giving me mis click, double click and both won't stay on hold position.
Very annoying when u r playing fps games like Valorant.
Won't stay in ads.
Go for this mouse if u r prepared to go for RMA.

81,"This mouse with its featureset and the price point should be a no brainer for anyone looking to get a light (not super light) mouse which can daily drive as well as game fludily. However, the cas eisn't so because of a singular major issue- the left click ends up glitching after anyhwere from 5-6 months to a year. It starts double clicking thereby totally screwing up the ability to daily drive this mouse or even play most games which rely on the left click as a primary action like FPS, TPS etc.
You're better off getting something else in the same price rage or perhaps investing antoher 1000-200 and bumping up to a logitech 500 serie smouse or something from Razer, steel series, corsair, glorious, hperx etc.","Reviewed in India on October 3, 2022"
82,"The mouse is good, the lightspeed wireless when it works is perfect. But the constant double clicking issues after an year or so and the bad switch quality is what ruins it. I got it replaced 3 times in 2 years and the last one got a bad receiver. The quality control on this is the worst. I own g102 and g402 and both work much better consistently. This one, I'd have to hope it works everytime I start gaming. Avoid this and get a wired option or save up and buy a gpro.","Reviewed in India on October 2, 2022"
