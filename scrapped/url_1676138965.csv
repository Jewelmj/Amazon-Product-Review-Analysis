 My mouse was working great for the first 3-4 months, but after that when I noticed scrolling issues I waited for a month to see if my laptop was an issue. After that I checked with multiple laptops and desktops and realised the mouse scroll wasn't working properly. I sent the product by RMA (which was quite fast) but they said they checked the product and didn't find any issue and sent it right back. I am now stuck with a mouse whose scroll isn't working and it hasn't even been 1 year yet. Go for this product on your own risk because cosmic byte warranty support is garbage.","Reviewed in India on February 3, 2023"
6," I do not know about the miniscule details and what other mouses have and this doesn't. To me for normal day work this is good and for ocassional gaming it will do just fine. Durability i can't comment on because I haven't used it much. The build quality is well good plastic and feels light weight in a good way. Wouldn't wanna drop it tho. The LED customisation is in the app you can download from cosmic byte website. The scroll wheel and logo color will change with the DPI mode, so that's a minus point. For negative I don't have much to say apart from 2 things... 1) The box came without any seal or packaging which is a huge safety hazard. 2) some parts might come damaged, in my case it was the extension adapter (small USB looking thing), but it's not that important of a part so you can ignore things like that.","Reviewed in India on January 26, 2023"
7,"At this budget the mice seemed to be good. But if you are planning to buy this for playing online competitive games like Valorant, CSGO, Overwatch etc, its better to look for better options. Not too suitable for playing these and there are better options to go for.
In other regard the mice seems good, but as this is also a gaming one, it is not living up to the expected expectations.","Reviewed in India on January 24, 2023"
8," Delivered on time, packing simple, box not having any seal packaging....
Connection fast, easy software interface, easy customization/configuration....
Although its for both hand users Need more ergonomic design for better grip as using Logitec 402 previously which is more ergonomic.
Chances of getting click/press of another side button accidentally.....
Flick shots are good in Valorant/CSGO....
RGB lights are good, while wing in Wireless mode RGB lights are off during mouse movements, works continuously in wired mode...
Honeycomb design is good...
Connector looks torn, please check yours.....
Cable is adequate long, light weight...
Overall Good, definatly considered....","Reviewed in India on January 20, 2023"
9,"This is the best wireless gaming mouse at this price range ..sensor is really good ,It has nice rgb ,comfortable and looks just like the glorious model O/D and its meant for medium to large hands.. quality is also good","Reviewed in India on January 19, 2023"
10,"I have been using this mouse for almost a year now. And I really enjoyed it. At first, I thought that the honeycomb pattern was not really good, but trust me, guys, it's really good; it makes your mouse feel so light.
Battery backup is good; I easily get 6-7 days of battery backup from a single charge; you might need to charge it more frequently if you are using it at a high USB polling rate and playing more games. I use it at 500Hz and 1600 DPI for everyday use and 800DPI for gaming.
The cable given with the mouse is also very high quality.
Overall quality is outstanding. If you don't want to charge, you can go for Logitech G304, which costs almost the same.","Reviewed in India on January 18, 2023"
11,So it's an excellent mouse that's no doubt..has everything a wireless gaming mouse should have.. sensor is also pretty decent....but it's NOT DOR FINGERTIP grip....it will shine with palm grip....i regret buying it after watching YouTube reviews...this shape is not suited for fingertip grip...if you are a wrist player like me go for g102 or wireless g304 in budget or cooler master cm710...those have much better shape for wrist players,"Reviewed in India on January 18, 2023"

23,"First i was skeptical to buy this mouse because there is not enough information on the internet about the latency test of this mouse. But I take the risk and ordered it. Now after using it for a month now I can tell that this is amazing mouse under 3k. No latency at all whether you play valorant, csgo or any other games. Note:- ( If you have desktop then use dongle extender provided in the package for low latency. I have laptop so there is no use of dongle extender)

Battery life is also good about 60+ hours of play time on one full charge. Charging time less than 2 hrs.

This mouse is for medium to large hands people. Small hands people will struggle for a day or two, like me.

36,"Overall usability of this mouse is amazing be it while gaming or normal day to day work on pc. The battery life depends on what mode you are using RGB or Non RGB and for how long but overall in my use it can work for 4 to 5 days and that's adequate. You can use it with wire attached so no problem with charging it again and again. The only thing that makes it a little bit cheap feeling is when i squeeze the left side of the portion where my thumb usually rest, you can feel that squeezing sound but it might only be with my product so there's that. Overall accessories and the quality of usability what matters so that's best you can get at this price.",Reviewed in India on 20 January 2023

Next comes the product inspection which took them 10 more days.
After 10 days I inquired on mail about the status dint get any response for 2 day which got me worried so I called the customer care. They gave me the updated saying we have check the product we will replace it. But since the product was out of stock I had to w8 again this was in May and June . Now I am writting this issue on July 16 and have not received the product yet.So it now 2 months that I am without my mouse.
So please please please buy this product only if you have a lot of patience and want to experience a very bad customer service.
Edit 1: Got my mouse replaced after 2.5 months of frustration. Now started having different issues with the mouse sensor not working properly. The mouse will stop moving at times for a few seconds before starting to work again. Not going to bother with asking or contacting customer care again as I don't want to go through their customer support service again. Overall will not recommend this product to anyone

Great sensor for the price.
Suites people who uses palm grip.

Cons -
Quite heavy af tbh. It does hurt my hand after long hours of gaming.
Software is very raw. It needs more R&D ( so as the product actually )

In my opinion, the customisation that it's providing is also killing the functionality by increasing the weight. It could be a better mosue without the customisation.

Would I buy it again? No there's better options of there.
Would I suggest this to my friends? I don't think so.","Reviewed in India on August 6, 2022"
