43,"Written after 3 months of daily use! Def recommended to humble peasants. This review is aimed at the college-goers or students in general, so y'all get a review from your age group and can know if it meets your needs or not.

First of, I must emphasize, this review is based on my experience with this device as a 20-year-old user. At this age, your average uses probably cover gaming, pretending to study, social media and casual browsing innit‚Äîrespectively ^^ let's go through this one by one.

These days buying a new Android smartphone can take up to 40 comparison videos, 20 unboxing views and 10 reviews and performance videos on Youtube before you decide on your top 3 choices. After nearly two months of obsessively camping on Youtube and thirsting for any potential new smartphones - my choices were Redmi Note 11 (love the boxy design), Redmi Note 10 Pro (64 MP camera) and this one, Redmi Note 10 Pro Max (108MP Camera).

What made me pick this model in particular (Note 10 Pro Max) is the 108 MP camera, which this series' foreign counterpart has but without the ""max"" name. We Indians get the 64 MP variant as Pro, while those abroad get the 108 MP variant as Pro. This subtle difference made me go with Pro Max, because that is the proper equivalent to the Pro they get overseas!

Other than the camera part, Pro Max is not in any way different compared to the Pro. Write that down.
Aight no more chattering, I'll be precise and specific~

APPEARANCE AND DURABILITY: It's smooth, sexy, shiny and somewhat resistant to finger impressions (only the matte finish models like glacial blue and bronze, though. Black will unmistakably take your finger impression like you are giving your biometrics for Aadhaar card). So appearance-wise, what you'll get is a total hottie. A classic beauty. I had a hard time choosing between black and blue, but went with blue and I don't regret it.

Durability? I dropped it flat on the back in a busy market road on the first day and it! Survived! With zero scratches! Hallelujah :D
HOWEVER, do keep in mind that the Pro and Pro Max are delicate devices and miserably failed their durability test as quickly as I disappoint my parents. Please don't try to flaunt it and use phone cases :(

Performance: ARGH THE MIUI CAN BE A PAIN SOMETIMES! It's mostly clean, with no more bloatware as it once was but there are definite bugs here and there. They're negligible though, in the sense of the rare times the screen jumps or flickers from the shoddy UI.

Downside examples: The proximity sensor my god I haven't come across anything as annoying in all my years as an IOS and then Samsung user. I would get a call and place it on my ear and bam! The call starts recording, the video call begins, the call goes mute, and all sorts of nonsense. It's a hurdle every single day! So yes, expect some marginal frustrations from the few caveats that come with the MIUI (I'm on UI 13 now). but if we generously forgive this - it's worth the hassle.

Gaming: I am not a phone gamer, I have my dedicated consoles for that so I don't play here. But I wanted to give it a try for name's sake and Genshin Impact ran smoothly. Don't expect much with a higher frame or graphics setting, but if you want some casual and mid-serious gaming? More than good enough!

Frame rate: Meh I never use the 120Hz refresh rate. 60Hz is sufficient for my daily usage and gives me enough joy, extra battery life and an overall easily likeable experience. Nevertheless, you can feel like Batman racing through Gotham in his Batmobile if you use the 120Hz just for the fancies. It gets all buttery-smooth if that is what you dig, I guess.

Battery: I keep my charging between 20-80% because duh, Lithium batteries. So it charges to 80 like in 40 minutes. The 33W charger they provide is splendid!
Because I use my phone like I'm a boomer with a landline connection, it easily gives me 42 hours of juice after continuous browsing, scrolling through cat reels and texting with my non-existence social life. On complete standby mode, where I just call or text, it can go to even 50+ hours on battery saver mode. On normal usage, some gaming or watching anime - still at least 24 hours. On semi-heavy usage, which is when I multitask between several apps or tabs for studying, still 15-20+ hours.* On heavy usage, like watching movies or using Zoom for online class or something, 6-10 hours.

*These are all averages and are different for everyone, but this is to give you an idea of the capacity. I don't watch movies or play games so it can go on for days! With my daily average, I can go until 30 hours on standby.

Camera: Ah sometimes I feel like it's a professional camera and sometimes it feels like 12 MP, but I suppose it depends on how good at taking pictures you are. It's sufficient, and night mode is very crisp and generally beautiful. I personally prefer this to other phones' 64 MP, so I can be certain that Pro Max is a sure upgrade to the Pro variant. No complains here.

Music area: Dual speakers are amazing, they blast into your drums. Smooth experience, the lossless audio or other in-app equalizer feature amps it up and you get a pretty satisfactory time banging your head to K-pop or Radiohead.

Hate that they don't include earphones, but they do give you a clear case that will turn yellow in 2 months!

Also, the screen is large enough and gorgeous, you don't get a cheap experience. At this price point? Worth every penny. I got it locally in my hometown and with offers so it's cheaper, but if you wait for Amazon sales like the Great Indian Festival and all - you can get it for 16,599 or something without card or exchange offers! :D It's a complete bang for the buck.

In contrast to other brands in this price range, through my extensive research before buying this phone, I can tell you that this phone is not at all outdated even if it's been two years since its release. It's worth it, even with the lack of 5G and sometimes annoying bugs from the UI. It's good to go for at least the next 2-3 years, so you can finally buy that IPhone you want in the future. I don't regret going for this <3 as an utility device, it serves its purposes like a piece of cake.","Reviewed in India on December 27, 2022"

We received our phone after the ordering process on 7h June 2021. According to this 547 days have not been completed. They have estimated 12,000 rupees for the repair of a 17,000 rupee phone. They have told me that a software update has made the front camera stop working. Why should I pay 12 thousand for updating the software that has made my front camera stop working?
