62,"This mouse is useless because it is jiggler mouse.. and automatically move one to other
side... without using mouse.. it is like someone control your mouse.. when you use this mouse it is starting to hake your pc and laptop and stolen your data... be aware for this..

I give big advice to all of you...","Reviewed in India on November 17, 2022"
63,"The mouse is good for doing daily task as it has back and forwardbuttons. gaming is very difficult as the tracking precision is very poor. If you are looking for a gaming mouse for games like csgo please buy wired mouse.

This can be recommended for kids as it has lights which are pleasing to look at. But this is definitely not for gamers.

For my gaming i am currently using death adder.","Reviewed in India on November 17, 2022"
64,"While this mouse feels quite good and has a great feel, the this to look out for is balance. At the bottom of the mouse, there is a switch to turn it on or off. Due to this, the mouse does not sit properly on the mouse pad. But after some time you get used to it and it does not hinder performance.","Reviewed in India on November 13, 2022"

72,"The sliding surfaces of this mouse are badly fitted. It is difficult to slide on mouse pads. Some surfaces are so thin that they do not even touch the pad surface, in effect you are dragging a mouse whose whole base is in contact with the mouse pad, that makes it hard to slide. I doubt it will do well for gaming where response required is much faster. It works well on hard surfaces without the pad but with shiny surfaces there is a problem. All the above explains why there is no return option for this product only replacement option is there but I doubt another piece will be any better. Most of the time it does not wake up after going to sleep. Does not work with cable alone while charging so if laptop is charging it then it occupies two USB Slots.","Reviewed in India on September 28, 2022"
