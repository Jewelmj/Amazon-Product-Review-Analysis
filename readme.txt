about: this project is about automaticly analysing the product review on amazon.

ideation: the last time i bought a amazon product, i had to go through the pains taking prcedure of reading the reviews one by one, 
            i wanted to solve this gap in the market by using the skills i have at the time of devolopment.

time of devolopment: during my first year of B-tech, 2022.

how it works: it uses selenium to "extract data" from amazon. then it preproces the data and plots a "word cloud" 
                for analysing whether the product is good or bad. along side the regular word cloud it plots a 
                "ai powered" wordcloud which analyses the text in a sentence and colors them based on whether they are good or bad.

technologys: it uses selenium to scrap the web. thinker for the ui. tensorflow to train a custom model. wordcloud to plot the wordcloud. pandas and nlp for preprocessing.

pros: Its a unique tool.

cons: it trains the model while the app is running which increases the time the app takes to start running.
